# Techvindesta ðŸ”‹

A mono-repository for all the projects of Techvindesta:
- CDK for managing infrastructure
- Lambda APIs for the backend
- Web app for the frontend

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16.19.1 (just run `nvm install && nvm use` to use the correct version)
- [serverless-cli](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) >= 3.0.0
- [aws-cdk-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html) >= 2.66.1
- [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (configured with credentials)

## Getting started

Before starting the work on any of these projects, make sure you have 
1. correct node version set up (`nvm install and nvm use`).
2. `aws-cli` installed and configured with aws credentials for programmatic access to the AWS account.

### CDK

1. Get familiar with the core concepts of CDK by going through the [CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript.html).
2. Once through, cd into infra directory (`cd apps/infra`) and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Note: this is only temporary until better integrations paths are available.
3. After completing the setup and making some changes, run `cdk synth` to see the changes that will be applied to the AWS account.
4. If the changes look good, and you wish to deploy, run `cdk list` to get a list of stages followed by `cdk deploy HidroStage/\* # etc` to apply the changes to the AWS account.
5. Open `CloudFormation` service in AWS console and check the status of the stack. If the status is `CREATE_COMPLETE`, you can move on to the next task.

### Serverless

1. `npm install`
2. `cd apps/hidro-api`
3. `cp .env.dist .env` and add the required values
4. `serverless offline` or `sls offline`. That's it! You can now access the API at `http://localhost:3000` and see how they work as you make changes locally.

## Deployment Workflow

While ideally all this should be done automatically through a CI/CD pipeline, for now, we will be deploying manually.

### CDK

As explained in `Getting started` section, `cdk synth` and `cdk deploy` are the two commands that you need to run to deploy the infrastructure. The `cdk synth` command will generate the CloudFormation template that will be applied to the AWS account. The `cdk deploy` command will apply the changes to the AWS account.

### Serverless

1. `cd apps/hidro-api`
2. `sls deploy --stage production`
