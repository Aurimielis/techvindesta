# Techvindesta ðŸ”‹

A mono-repository for all the projects of Techvindesta:
- CDK for managing infrastructure
- Lambda APIs for the backend
- Web app for the frontend

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) >= 16.19.1 (just run `nvm install && nvm use` to use the correct version)
- [serverless-cli](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/getting-started/) >= 3.0.0
- [aws-cdk-cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cdk/v2/guide/cli.html) >= 2.66.1
- [aws-cli](https://aws.amazon.com/cli/) (configured with credentials)

## Getting started

Before starting the work on any of these projects, make sure you have 
1. correct node version set up (`nvm install and nvm use`).
2. `aws-cli` installed and configured with aws credentials for programmatic access to the AWS account.

### CDK

1. Get familiar with the core concepts of CDK by going through the [CDK Workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/20-typescript.html).
2. Once through, cd into infra directory (`cd apps/infra`) and run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. Note: this is only temporary until better integrations paths are available.
3. After completing the setup and making some changes, run `cdk synth` to see the changes that will be applied to the AWS account.
4. If the changes look good, and you wish to deploy, run `cdk list` to get a list of stages followed by `cdk deploy HidroStage/\* # etc` to apply the changes to the AWS account.
5. Open `CloudFormation` service in AWS console and check the status of the stack. If the status is `CREATE_COMPLETE`, you can move on to the next task.

### Serverless

1. `cp apps/hidro-api/.env.dist apps/hidro-api/.env` and add the required values
2. `npm run api:sls:start`. That's it! You can now access the API at `http://localhost:3000` and see how they work as you make changes locally.

### API Application

Just run `npm run api:start` and you are good to go. The API will be available at `http://localhost:3001`.

### Web app

`nx serve web`

## Running tests

TBA (To Be Added)

## Deployment Workflow

While ideally all this should be done automatically through a CI/CD pipeline, for now, we will be deploying manually.

### CDK

As explained in `Getting started` section, `cdk synth` and `cdk deploy` are the two commands that you need to run to deploy the infrastructure. The `cdk synth` command will generate the CloudFormation template that will be applied to the AWS account. The `cdk deploy` command will apply the changes to the AWS account.

### Serverless

`npm run api:deploy -- --stage <stage>` to deploy the API to the specified stage. At the moment, we only have `production`.

### API

Changes are deployed automatically when pushed to `main` branch. The deployment is done through [CircleCI](https://app.circleci.com/pipelines/github/beniusij/techvindesta?branch=main)

## Web App

**Important:** If it's first time deploying to the app, make sure to change platform type to `WEB_COMPUTE` as described in official [AWS Amplify documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amplify/latest/userguide/redeploy-ssg-to-ssr.html:
```bash
aws amplify update-app --profile <aws profile> --app-id <app id> --platform WEB_COMPUTE --region <region>
```

1. Commit local changes and push them to the remote
2. Open a PR and merge it to `main` branch after it got reviews and tests passing
3. Merge to `main` will trigger a deployment which AWS Amplify will pick up and deploy the app to the production environment
